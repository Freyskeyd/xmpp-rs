# xmpp-rs

`xmpp-rs` is an XMPP client library (for now). Under active development.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Freyskeyd/xmpp-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Freyskeyd/xmpp-rs)

## Install

This library is splitted in 3 crates (`client`, `server`, `proto`). As defined by the naming, you can use every crate
independently.

- `xmpp-client`: will allow you to build a client.
- `xmpp-server`: is an implementation of XMPP on server side.
- `xmpp-rs`: Grab both client and server in a single crate.

**Cargo.toml**

```toml
xmpp-rs = "0.1"
```

```rust
// Client
extern crate xmpp;

```
## Build

To build xmpp-rs:

`cargo build --release`
